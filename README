iPOLARRIS

This is a complimentary program to POLARRIS-f, a forward model for producing polarimetric radar observations from model simulations. This suite of tools reads in gridded data (from radar or simulation), runs radar retrievals, and makes standardized plots.

***NOTE: ipol.sh only works for iMAC environment.***
